What is a regular expression?
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that create a pattern. We can use regular expressions to search for
 and find these patterns in strings, which enables us to perform complex pattern-matching on strings.

Let's imagine we are given the following string: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." If you were tasked
 with finding the word "jumps," that would not be too difficult. But what happens when you are tasked with finding three
  or four word characters that start with a vowel and contain at least one other vowel? Finding matching patterns like this 
  requires something a bit more powerful: that's where regular expressions, or 'regex,' come in.

Regular expressions are commonly used to validate emails, phone numbers, zip codes, passwords, and much more. They are
 also used to find or replace characters in text files, which makes knowing them very helpful. So let's get started with 
 creating a regular expression and seeing which JavaScript methods can help us with finding patterns.

Regular Expression syntax
One way to create a regular expression is to place the pattern between two forward slashes //. Do not worry too much 
about what patterns look like, we will start with a very simple one. Let's match an exact string of characters. Here is
 what that looks like:

var pattern = /Elie/;
